## Inspiration

As a current intern at a big tech company who has been working from home for a couple years now, I gained inspiration from certain hackathon streams to improve the wfh/hybrid experience, as well as the onboarding experience. My goal with this project is to increase engagement and excitement, reduce media/information clutter, and make a team feel like a team, regardless of if everyone is at home or the office.

Integrates with common software/tools such as GSuite (Google Calendar & Gmail), Slack, Zoom, etc to ease portability.

I'm a backend enjoyer so I decided to challenge (torture) myself this weekend by trying something new and predominantly frontend. I was inspired by the hackathon streams and decided to try Velo by Wix to achieve this, which is a really cool tool. Thanks ConUHacks!
